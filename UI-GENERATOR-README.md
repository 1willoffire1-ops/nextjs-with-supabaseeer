# UI Generator for Vatana - FIXED ✅

This project has been updated to fix the 404 errors and provide a working UI generation system.

## What Was Fixed

### ❌ Original Issues
- **404 Errors**: The original code tried to use non-existent Figma API endpoints (`POST /files/{file_key}/nodes`)
- **Figma API Limitations**: The Figma REST API is read-only and doesn't support creating/modifying design elements
- **Missing Environment**: No `.env` file was configured
- **Invalid API Calls**: All Figma API calls were failing because the endpoints don't exist

### ✅ Solutions Implemented

1. **Replaced Figma API with HTML/CSS Generation**
   - Created `HTMLUIGenerator` class as a replacement for `FigmaCreator`
   - Generates beautiful, interactive HTML mockups instead of trying to create Figma elements
   - Includes modern CSS styling and JavaScript interactivity

2. **Fixed Environment Setup**
   - Added proper `.env` file with all necessary configuration
   - Removed dependency on Figma API tokens for basic functionality

3. **Enhanced UI Generation**
   - Login screens with proper input fields and styling
   - Dashboard layouts with stat cards
   - Contact forms with interactive elements
   - Button collections and custom layouts

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
node ui-prompt.js "create a login screen with email and password"
node ui-prompt.js "create a dashboard with stats cards"
node ui-prompt.js "create a contact form"
node ui-prompt.js "design a product card with buy button"
```

### Generated Output
- HTML files are saved in the `generated-ui/` directory
- Each file includes:
  - Responsive CSS styling
  - Interactive JavaScript
  - Professional design elements
  - Proper accessibility features

### Supported UI Types
- **Login Screens**: Email/password forms with modern styling
- **Dashboards**: Stat cards, headers, and analytics layouts
- **Contact Forms**: Input fields with validation styling
- **Product Cards**: Cards with descriptions and action buttons
- **Button Collections**: Various button styles and states
- **Custom UIs**: Generated from any text prompt
