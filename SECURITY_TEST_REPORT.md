### 3. CORS Protection (`lib/security/cors.ts`)

```typescript
✅ Whitelist allowed origins
✅ Preflight request handling
✅ Access-Control headers
✅ Origin validation
✅ Credentials support
```

**Security Headers:**
```
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Content-Security-Policy: (configured)
