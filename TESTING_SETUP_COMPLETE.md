## 🚀 How to Use

### Run Unit Tests

```powershell
# Watch mode (recommended for development)
pnpm test

# Run once (CI mode)
pnpm test --run

# With UI
pnpm test:ui

# With coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

### Run E2E Tests

```powershell
# Make sure dev server is not running, then:
pnpm test:e2e

# With UI (interactive mode)
pnpm test:e2e:ui

# Headed mode (see browser)
pnpm test:e2e --headed

# Debug mode
pnpm test:e2e --debug
```

### Run All Tests

```powershell
pnpm test:all
```

---

## 📊 Test Coverage

Coverage reports are generated in `coverage/` directory.

To view coverage:
```powershell
pnpm test:coverage
# Then open: coverage/index.html
```

**Coverage Goals:**
- Components: 80%+
- Utilities: 90%+
- API Routes: 70%+

## 📝 Writing New Tests

### Unit Test Template

Create file: `src/__tests__/my-component.test.tsx`

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import { MyComponent } from '@/components/MyComponent'

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('should render correctly', () => {
    render(<MyComponent />)
    expect(screen.getByText('Expected Text')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
```

### E2E Test Template

Create file: `src/__tests__/e2e/my-feature.spec.ts`

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'

test('should perform user action', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/my-page')
  await page.click('button[name="submit"]')
  await expect(page.getByText('Success')).toBeVisible()
})
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. ✅ Run `pnpm test:e2e` to verify E2E tests work
2. Write tests for critical components:
   - VAT analysis upload flow
   - Results dashboard
   - Theme switching

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Add tests for API routes
2. Test error handling scenarios
3. Test dark mode functionality
4. Add tests for form validation

### Medium-term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Achieve 80% code coverage
2. Set up CI/CD testing pipeline
3. Add visual regression tests
4. Performance testing

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Unit tests not running?
```powershell
# Clear cache
pnpm test --run --no-cache
```

### E2E tests failing?
```powershell
# Reinstall browsers
pnpm playwright install chromium

# Check if port 3000 is available
# Stop any running dev server first
```

### Coverage not generating?
```powershell
# Install coverage provider
pnpm add -D @vitest/coverage-v8
```
